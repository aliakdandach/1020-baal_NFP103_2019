ACCOV project<br />
This project i did after i finished the ACCOV Cours at CNAM (Conservatoire national des arts et m√©tiers).<br />
this project is similar to IRC (Internet Relay Chat).It is desired to create a client / server system that makes it possible to communicate with several simultaneously onthe network.<br />

Client side:<br />
------------<br />
1-the client sends messages (text) to the server.<br />
2-the client accepts the following commands typed:<br />
/t2.1.1-who:List all clients connected to server<br />
/t2.1.2-connect:Connect to the server ex: connect -u root -p root -h 192.168.0.10:5555<br />
/t2.1.3-help:Print a help message<br />
/t2.1.4-quit:Exit application<br />
/t2.2.1-to_usr:chat peer-to-peer with another user ex: to_usr pc1 message<br />
/t2.3.1-to_group:chat with memebers group ex: to_group grp1 message<br />
/t2.3.2-create_grp:create group ex: create_grp nameOfYourGroup<br />
/t2.3.3-delete_grp:delete group if you are admin of group ex: delete_grp nameOfGroup<br />
/t2.3.4-exit_grp:exit group ex: exit_grp nameOfGroup<br />
/t2.3.5-list_grp:list all groups founded on the server<br />
/t2.3.6-members:list all members in groups ex: members nameOfGroup<br />
/t2.4.1-send_to:send file to someone connected to the server ex: send_to pc1 pathOfYourFile<br />

 Server side:/n
 ------------/n
1-the server broadcasts all messages (text) it receives from one of these clients to all other clients
connected and known./n
2-the server accepts the following commands:/n
/t2.1.1-who:List all clients connected to server/n
/t2.1.2-help:Print a help message/n
/t2.1.3-kill:kill user ex: kill pc1/n
/t2.1.4-quit:Exit application/n
/t2.1.5-start:Configure a machine to listen on a specific port ex: start 5555/n
/t3.1.1-delete_grp:delete group if you are admin of group ex: delete_grp nameOfGroup/n
/t3.1.2-list_grp:list all groups founded on the server/n

I use Log4j for logging and Junit 5 for testing.
